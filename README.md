# What Is SuperMarkoBrothers
SuperMarkoBrothers, or SMB for short, is a 2D platformer inspired by the classics.
The game has a retro vibe but is designed to run on modern hardware and include modern features.

# Why C#
SuperMarkoBrothers was originally written in Python, but not very well.
So we decided to fix it and rewrite it in C#.
Why did we choose C#?
We felt it was a language we should become more familiar with,
so we decided to kill two birds with one stone.
and use C# for our project.
